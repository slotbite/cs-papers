This is a git-annex repository of some CS papers, meant for poring
over on some rainy/snowy days.

Please note the labored avoidance of any first person pronoun at all.
That, as you might imagine, is intentional.

To make a local copy, clone this repository, and then do this:

    git annex init
    git annex get .

And `git annex sync origin` to keep stuff up-to-date.
